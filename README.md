# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is Brandon Croarkin, I am an aspiring Data Scientist located in Arlington, VA (right outside of DC). I am currently working as a data analyst and also working to obtain my Master's Degree in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University. I mainly work in R and Python, but am still learning both!
